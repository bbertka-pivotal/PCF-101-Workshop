= Lab 4 - Monitoring your Application

[abstract]
--
Pivotal Cloudfoundry makes the work of performing operations actions, such as scaling, doing a zero-downtime deploy, and managing application health very easy.
In the this labs we'll continue to explore Pivotal Cloudfoundry application operations.

== Applciation Container and Network Monitoring with PCF Metrics

PCF Metrics helps developers better understand the health and performance of their apps by providing a near real-time view of critical data. Developers can see performance issues within two to three seconds, learn about events like an app crash as they occur, and look back in time to see what happened while they were away.

For developers, thereâ€™s nothing to install or configure, just select an app and watch the data stream. 

_PCF Metrics provides the following data on app health and performance_

* Container metrics: CPU, memory, and disk percentages (updated every 30 seconds)
* HTTP metrics: requests per second, HTTP errors per second, and request latency (updated every second)
* App events: create, update, start, stop, and crash (updated as they happen)

*To get started, browse to the Metrics URL:*

== Tailing Application Logs

One of the most important enablers of visibility into application behavior is logging.
Effective management of logs has historically been very difficult.
Cloud Foundry's https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator[log aggregation] components simplify log management by assuming responsibility for it.
Application developers need only log all messages to either `STDOUT` or `STDERR`, and the platform will capture these messages.

=== For Developers

Application developers can view application logs using the CF CLI.

. Let's view recent log messages for the application.  For this lab you can use the Java, Ruby, or Node.js sample app.  In each of the commands below replace _workshop_ with the name of your deployed application:
+
----
$ cf logs workshop --recent
----

Here are two interesting subsets of one output from that command:

As you can see, Cloud Foundry's log aggregation components capture both application logs and CF component logs relevant to your application.
These events are properly interleaved based on time, giving you an accurate picture of events as they transpired across the system.

. To get a running ``tail'' of the application logs rather than a dump, simply type:
+
----
$ cf logs workshop
----
+
You can try various things like refreshing the browser and triggering stop/start events to see logs being generated.

== Health Management

Cloud Foundry's http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/architecture/#hm9k[Heatlh Manager] actively monitors the health of our application processes and will restart them should they crash.

. If you don't have one already running, start a log tail for `workshop`.  
+
----
$ cf logs workshop
----

. If you do not have more than one application instance running, execute the scale command to scale to 2 or more application instances.  Visit the application in the browser, and click on the ``Kill Switch'' button. This button will trigger a JVM exit with an error code (`System.exit(1)`), causing the Health Manager to observe an application instance crash:
+
image::lab.png[]

. After clicking the kill switch a couple of interesting things should happen.
First, you'll see an error code returned in the browser, as the request you submitted never returns a response:
+
image::lab1.png[]
+
Also, if you're paying attention to the log tail, you'll see some interesting log messages fly by:

== Viewing Application _Events_

Cloud Foundry only allows application configuration to be modified via its API.
This gives application operators confidence that all changes to application configuration are known and auditable.
It also reduces the number of causes that must be considered when problems arise.

All application configuration changes are recorded as _events_.
These events can be viewed via the Cloud Foundry API, and viewing is facilitated via the CLI.

Take a look at the events that have transpired so far for our deployment of `workshop`:

<1> Events are sorted newest to oldest, so we'll start from the bottom.
Here we see the `app.create` event, which created our application's record and stored all of its metadata (e.g. `memory: 512`).
<2> The `app.map-route` event records the incoming request to assign a route to our application.
<3> This `app.update` event records the resulting change to our applications metadata.
<4> This `app.update` event records the change of our application's state to `STARTED`.
<5> Remember scaling the application up? This `app.update` event records the metadata change `instances: 5`.
<6> And here's the `app.crash` event recording that we encountered a crash of an application instance.
